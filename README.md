Learning how to make applications in Flutter

## Working with Cards

Cards are cousins to Cards in Android. The only difference is there is no padding, so we need to wrap our child into a Padding object.
We leave a `Row` within first card, but show a `ListTile` which does the same.

Not even my early Android experiments looked this cool!!
