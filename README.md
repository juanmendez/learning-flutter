Learning how to make applications in Flutter

## Working with Containers, Padding and Margin

- There are multiple types of containers. Some can take many children such as `Column`, where others can only take one such as `Container`.
- `SafeArea` is a container that ensures content is bound to be attached below the status bar.
- Padding and Margin work hand in hand with what's being used by CSS, and Android styling.
- We can make use of `inspector` -> `hide/debug paint` to show us how margin and padding plays out, see graphic below.
- We can quickly nest a selected widget by hitting `alt + enter`, there we see a floating menu with multiple containers to choose from.
- Remember an extra comma added in our arguments set in a function helps us to make our code to format nicely.
