Learning how to make applications in Flutter

## Getting Started

We are now moving into refactoring and making reusable components. Some time ago I worked with [Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org/).
Having new ways of making custom html elements which were components themselves and could handle logic, and styling within while still making those htmls tags with custom attributes.

Flutter is using in some ways that type of approach to making applications in a ravioli structure.
In this way right now all buttons are of type `BmiCard`. Where as the ones at the top include a widget child.
In our case we make now an iconic widget to nest of type `Icon Widget`. So Flutter is becoming more fun than I expected in giving opportunities to reuse our code and include logic within.

As an Android developer I am clung into using constant values for resources, so I also made a `res.dart` file which includes colors, and dimensions in the same way we are used to in our Android applications.
