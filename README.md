### [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) & [Json-Serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable)

When it comes to making immutable objects Kotlin is really good at with no sweat using [`data classes`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html). We also using libraries like [`Moshi`](https://github.com/square/moshi) which can de-serialize from json and serialize to json. In Dart we don't have that luxury yet, but we can make use of Freezed which is capable of generating all the code needed to make our classes immutable and also have copies specifying what remains the same and what we want to have changed.

We can also have our Dart classes have code generated to turn a json object into an instance of a specific class sort of what `Moshi` does. Similarly we can also have the instance become a json object. We can do that using `json_serializable`, so we can go on and on making use of these tools throughout all our data classes. 

The great thing about these two libraries is we can work along and from one data class and have it becoming immutable/clonable and json serialized/de-serialized. üëç 

Here is an example

Where `Message` is our data class, and `Message.freezed.dart` is generated by Freezed, and `Message.g.dart` by Json-Serializable. There is a good chunk of data generated, but our data class remains small.

```
@freezed
abstract class Message with _$Message {
  factory Message({String sender, String text}) = _Message;
  factory Message.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$MessageFromJson(json);
}
```

So these two libraries take a big amount of tedious work from us to do, and are free from typos. One thing I wish there was a Jetbrains plugin for both in order to have Message class already being declared as abstract and making use of the _$DataClass mixin, as well as the factories. We can always create a live template to do that as well.

## Notes
Please run `flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` in order to start watching for changes for `json-serializable` and `freezed`
